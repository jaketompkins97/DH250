      <p>Every year the United States experiences an array of nautral disasters including <b>hurricanes</b>, <b>earthquakes</b>, <b>floods</b>, <b>wildfires</b>, <b>tornados</b>, and <b>droughts</b>. In the event of an emergency, it is critical for users to have immediate access to information and emergency services that could be life saving. This project offers a new type of resource that could help users navigate a disaster safely and efficiently.</p>

          <p> <i>How can I design a digital experience that eases the burden of finding information during a crisis and lets users feel more secure in their decisions before, during, and after an emergency?</i>

        <p class="card-text"> During COVID-19 I realized how important it is to get quick, reliable, and relevant information that can impact the public's health and safety. This global emergency has been a new experience for so many people and has illuminated our dependence on the government and reliable sources of information for decision-making. I started considering how I am new to the state of California and many of the common disasters that are unique to this area, like earthquakes and wildfires. After experiencing the Bobcat Fires in the fall of 2020, I decided that I wanted to design a website that could be useful to people who are also experiencing disasters that are unfamiliar to them.<br><br> 

        This project seeks to help users identify potential disasters happening near them or their loved ones and offer features that could help them in preparation before an emergency situation occurs. Users' needs are situation-specific and thus it's important that these diverse needs are met depending on the urgency of the disaster they may be experiencing or are about to experience. This tool could change how people find information about disasters and may offer services that could save lives in the future.

            <p class="card-text">The resource that inspired this project was <a href="https://www.disasterassistance.gov/" target="_blank">DisasterAssistance.gov</a>, which is a government site that lets users find valuable information on different disasters and apply for federal aid. During my heurisitic analysis I realized that this site is incredibly flawed and can be difficult to navigate and perform actions with. I wanted to create a new type of resource that includes the valuable information from this site, but with a more intuitive layout and modern design. <br><br>
            
            This website taught me that there is a deluge of valuable information that could be lifesaving in emergency situations, but that the process of finding and digesting this information is very overwhelming in its current format. My hope in creating this site is to remedy this negative experience by offering streamlined services that can help users confidently make decisions during extremely stressful situations.

            <p class="card-text">Despite having an idea of what I wanted for the final product, I knew I had to learn more about what the users wanted and needed. My classmate, an Asian American Studies major, offered to give me a glimpse into what her day looked like. <br><br>

            I went into our Zoom call not knowing what insights I would glean but knowing that I wanted to see how she discovered information about a topic of interest. After discussing some background questions, I asked if she could show me how she typically finds information on the internet. It turns out she had been starting on her senior thesis on Asian American issues and decided to show me how she found sources for her paper.

            <p class="card-text">One central way to develop empathy for our users is to take their perspective. We can do this by creating personas, scenarios, user journeys, and empathy maps. These transport us out of our own lives and into the lives of our users. Throughout the design process, we can think back to our users' context through these materials. <br><br>

            Drawing from the contextual inquiry findings, I created a persona that captured the motivations, needs, and goals of the participant. Because I wanted to create a product for users from diverse backgrounds, I created two additional proto-personas by synthesizing information from the contextual inquiry and from my recollection of people in my life.

            <p class="card-text">Taking the perspective of my personas led me to incorporate three different features into my website. I wanted to allow users to: <br><br>
            •	Explore the history of Asian American communities with an interactive timeline
            •	Watch videos and documentaries about art, culture, social issues, and politics
            •	Find teaching resources to support curriculums related to Asian American topics<br><br>
            With these scenarios in mind, I took to translating them into tangible screen designs. Because the site centers around history, education, and culture, I wanted it to exude a professional, sophisticated air. At the same time, I wanted it to be approachable and refreshing.

            1.	Finding more about a historical event on the timeline
            2.	Download a file for a lesson plan

            <p class="card-text">To bring my project to life, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. This helped me envision what the end product might look like and provided a concrete visualization that could be tested with users. By alternating between designing screens and testing with users, I could iterate towards a better user experience.

# Designing for Crisis Management
#### DH 250 - Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities: User Experience Design

My name is **Jake Tompkins** and I am a graduate student in UCLA's Department of Information Studies. This Github repository is for my UX  project surrounding the design of applications and websites used to find necessary information during a crisis or emergency. This project was inspired by my research interests in the field of [**Crisis (Disaster) Informatics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_informatics).

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

#### 1. [**Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fema/id474807486) Mobile Application

![FEMA app](FEMA.jpeg)

***App Description:*** This mobile application is used to receive emergency alerts and information so that users are prepared before, during, and after disasters. The app can be used to receive safety notifications, do-it-yourself emergency preparedness tips, and other disaster resources.

***Overall Evaluation:*** This application does not have a very great UI. The infrastructure for signing up for text alerts is very blackbox and difficult for users to understand what is going on. It is easy to make errors and nearly impossible to go back and correct actions once they are made. Various drop-down menus are nested within each other which makes it difficult for users to find the information they are seeking (all of the important information is there, it just isn't laid out neatly!)

#### 2. [**DisasterAssistance.gov**](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/) Website

***App Description:*** This government resource is used to provide disaster survivors with information, support, services, and a means to access and apply for disaster assistance through join data-sharing efforts between federal, tribal, state, local, and private sector partners.

***Overall Evaluation:*** This website contains valuable information and links to important forms for users to fill out, but it is really difficult to navigate. When a user fills out the form their responses are not saved and they are required to either print a copy or email their responses to save them. Other resources on the website are rendered useless, for example the interactive map that users can look up their address to find local resources. This tool will produce results for resources located 400+ miles away that would be practically useless in the midst of an emergency and will not offer alternative options if there's nothing nearby.

## Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Test

#### Introduction

The DisasterAssistance.gov website is intended for people who have experienced (or expect to experience) some form of disaster. Information about various types of disasters, as well as resources available to help in the event of these disasters, are made available on the site. There are also applications for assistance built into the site so users can apply directly for various services and other forms of support.

After conducting a heuristic evaluation of the site, I recognized a few potential issues. Most notably, I noticed that the website's information architecture makes the website confusing to navigate. I also noticed issues with the application process for federal assistance. When users try to complete the application, it does not save their responses and encourages them to email themselves a copy or print the page. To assess the usability of the site, I have designed a usability test which challenges a potential user with realistic tasks to complete using the website.

#### Methodology

I will be doing a remote moderated usability test conducted via Zoom and recorded using Camtasia2020. I will be moderating the test remotely, while the participant completes the test from their home. We will communicate through Zoom while they complete the tasks I ask them.

I will begin the test with an introduction of who I am and why I have asked them to participate, followed by an icebreaker and asking if they have any questions before we begin. Once I have received informed consent from the participant, I will ask them to complete 3 separate tasks that a user would typically use the website for. Each of these 3 tasks have sub-tasks that I will break down for the user. At the end, I will have the participant answer some post-test questions to give me insights on their experience completing the 3 tasks. Within this section of the test, I will have the user select 5 cards that represent their overall experience with the website. Finally, before submitting their responses, I will have the user answer some (optional) confidential demographic questions to collect some extra data. Although their responses won't be shared, I will ask the user to only answer questions they feel comfortable with.

#### Reflection
During the usability test I found it really difficult not to answer the participant's questions when they felt frustrated. There were times when I expected the user to take a certain route, but her thought process took her in a different direction than what I had anticipated. In future UT's, I hope that I will do a better job not guiding the participant and letting them work through the task and problem solve on their own.

My primary concern with the UT was to see how well the user was able to use the navigation panel from the home page to find specific information for the tasks. As I expected, the participant clicked on pages that *seemed* to be correct, but actually led them away from the page of the website that they were looking for. From this UT, I believe there are several things that could be changed about the site to improve how quickly a user could find the information they need without the frustration of being misguided by the architecture of information currently used.

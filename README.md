# Designing for Crisis Management
#### DH 250 - Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities: User Experience Design

My name is **Jake Tompkins** and I am a graduate student in UCLA's Department of Information Studies. This Github repository is for my UX  project surrounding the design of applications and websites used to find necessary information during a crisis or emergency. This project was inspired by my research interests in the field of [**Crisis (Disaster) Informatics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_informatics).

## Assignment 1:
***
#### 1. [**Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Mobile Application**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fema/id474807486)

![FEMA App](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple124/v4/5e/f8/35/5ef83525-e934-039e-fa7e-22f4aeb3ebda/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-10-0-0-0-0-85-220.png/700x400wa.png)

***App Description:*** This mobile application is used to receive emergency alerts and information so that users are prepared before, during, and after disasters. The app can be used to receive safety notifications, do-it-yourself emergency preparedness tips, and other disaster resources.

***Overall Evaluation:*** This application does not have a very great UI. The infrastructure for signing up for text alerts is very blackbox and difficult for users to understand what is going on. It is easy to make errors and nearly impossible to go back and correct actions once they are made. Various drop-down menus are nested within each other which makes it difficult for users to find the information they are seeking (all of the important information is there, it just isn't laid out neatly!)

#### 2. [**DisasterAssistance.gov Website**](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/)

![DisasterAssistance.gov logo](https://veterans_nexus.s3.amazonaws.com/organizations/disaster-assistance.jpg)

***App Description:*** This government resource is used to provide disaster survivors with information, support, services, and a means to access and apply for disaster assistance through join data-sharing efforts between federal, tribal, state, local, and private sector partners.

***Overall Evaluation:*** This website contains valuable information and links to important forms for users to fill out, but it is really difficult to navigate. When a user fills out the form their responses are not saved and they are required to either print a copy or email their responses to save them. Other resources on the website are rendered useless, for example the interactive map that users can look up their address to find local resources. This tool will produce results for resources located 400+ miles away that would be practically useless in the midst of an emergency and will not offer alternative options if there's nothing nearby.

## Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry
### The Design Challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?

The main focus of my project is to help users who have just experienced some type of disaster be able to identify resources that can support them. These resources can be informational, financial, or services available to users after being exposed to an emergency situation.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

For this activity, a user needs urgent assistance (informational, financial, or via a service) in response to an emergency they have just experienced.

#### What are the current solutions available to satisfy those needs?

Alternatives are calling 911 or simple Google searches for specific forms of assistance. However, users who are in emergency situations may not know what type of assistance is available to them, so these resources can be:
* A.) time consuming to navigate if the user has lots of questions they need answered
* B.) not helpful for users who don't know what exactly they should search for and are struggling with a very stressful/intense situation that impacts their decision-making.

#### What are some limitations that would be improved with technology?

Having the right technology, users would be able to quickly find the information they need without having to know the right questions to ask. Users who have just experienced an emergency situation (or expect to experience one soon) typically struggle with decision-making because of how stressful and intense the situation can be.

### Target users

#### What are the characteristics of users?

Demographic: middle aged or older individuals who have/might experience(d) a disaster or emergency and require assistance

Preferences: users in these difficult situations usually need help right away

Expertise: users are not expected to have any specialized knowledge to use the app/website

#### Where would the users do that activity?

Users will often be looking for assistance from their homes using either a computer or their cellphone. However, if a user has just experienced a disaster that required them to evacuate, they may be completing the activity on their mobile device while traveling. If the user is currently experiencing a crisis, they may be in a difficult situation that is very distracting and hard to concentrate during.

#### What would users to do complete that activity?

To complete the activity, users may use their search browser on their computer or mobile device and begin searching questions about the disaster they are experiencing. Alternatively, if the situation is severe enough, a user may dial 911 to speak to someone directly who could help them.

### Research Methods

The research methods I employed for this assignment were through **participatory observation** with a follow up **interview** by directly asking the user some insightful questions.
* Through **participatory observation** I can directly observe a user completing a task to see how they would normally go about finding the information they need.
* I will also **interview** the user to ask them specific questions and have a discussion about what they would do in specific situations given there was an emergency.

### Insights from the interview
* User doesn't experience disasters frequently so isn't quite sure what to expect when searching them
* User finds URL's with .gov to be most useful and reliable when searching for information related to disasters
* If the user receives alerts about disasters she will usually adhere to the alerts, but won't investigate the disaster further by looking up online
* Unexpected things user said she looks up disasters for:
  * Finding information about damaged roofs for her work (selling roofs)
  * Checking up on disasters in areas where close friends live, as opposed to where she lives  
* User never mentioned wanting to look up assistance after experiencing a disaster (could be because she doesn't experience them often?)

### Reflection
I really enjoyed doing the contextual inquiry because it was more conversational and let me hear more about how the user feels about the topic of my project. It was kind of difficult at times because I would ask the user questions about how they would search for information about disasters, but the user lives in Ohio where natural disasters don't happen frequently so I could tell she was struggling to come up with answers for some of my questions. If I could do this type of research again, I would have liked to interview someone who experiences natural disasters frequently, like someone living in Florida who deals with hurricanes every fall, or someone in California who deals with earthquakes and wildfires. It would be helpful to talk with somebody who just recently experienced a disaster, so they could reflect on how that experience felt in more detail.
